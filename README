This is a simple server capable of handling requests from multiple clients, where clients can join or leave at any time. 
This server only implements a simple service, converting strings to title-case.

1. Run make to compile client and server.
2. ./stringServer
3. Manually set the SERVER ADDRESS and SERVER PORT environment variables on the client machine. (Use setenv if using C shell)
4. ./stringClient (The client may not be running on the same machine as the server)
5. Enter string(s) on client machine

Note:
1. Part of code is reused from <Beej's Guide to Network Programming> as indicated in comment.
2. As long as server and client run normally, no error message should be printed.
